## Classes

At first, classes seem very similar to structs because we use them to create new data types with properties and methods. However, they introduce a new, important, and complex feature called inheritance – the ability to make one class build on the foundations of another.

This is a powerful feature, there’s no doubt about it, and there is no way to avoid using classes when you start building real iOS apps. 

SwiftUI uses structs extensively for its UI design. Well, it uses classes extensively for its data: when you show data from some object on the screen, or when you pass data between your layouts, you’ll usually be using classes.
